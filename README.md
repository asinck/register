[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asinck/register.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asinck/register)

The goal of this project is to provide a demo program and to gain experience in:

-   Java
-   GUI development
-   Gradle
-   Software development, in the context of a large project (for one person), with long-running development
-   TravisCI
-   Anything else as I see fit, and possibly some things I missed

The initial project is a serious work in progress.
